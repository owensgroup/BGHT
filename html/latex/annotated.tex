The hash table is an open addressing hash table based on the cuckoo hashing probing scheme (bucket size of one and using four hash functions) }{\pageref{structbght_1_1cht}}{}

The hash table is an open addressing hash table based on the cuckoo hashing probing scheme (bucketed and using a primary hash function and two secondary hash functions) }{\pageref{structbght_1_1iht}}{}
