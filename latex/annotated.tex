\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structbght_1_1bcht}{bght\+::bcht$<$ Key, T, Hash, Key\+Equal, Scope, Allocator, B $>$}} \\*BCHT BCHT (bucketed cuckoo hash table) is an associative static GPU hash table that contains key-\/value pairs with unique keys. The hash table is an open addressing hash table based on the cuckoo hashing probing scheme (bucketed and using three hash functions) }{\pageref{structbght_1_1bcht}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structbght_1_1cht}{bght\+::cht$<$ Key, T, Hash, Key\+Equal, Scope, Allocator $>$}} \\*CHT CHT (cuckoo hash table) is an associative static GPU hash table that contains key-\/value pairs with unique keys. The hash table is an open addressing hash table based on the cuckoo hashing probing scheme (bucket size of one and using four hash functions) }{\pageref{structbght_1_1cht}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structbght_1_1iht}{bght\+::iht$<$ Key, T, Hash, Key\+Equal, Scope, Allocator, B, Threshold $>$}} \\*IHT IHT (iceberg hash table) is an associative static GPU hash table that contains key-\/value pairs with unique keys. The hash table is an open addressing hash table based on the double hashing probing scheme (bucketed and using a primary hash function followed by double hashing) }{\pageref{structbght_1_1iht}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structbght_1_1p2bht}{bght\+::p2bht$<$ Key, T, Hash, Key\+Equal, Scope, Allocator, B $>$}} \\*P2\+BHT P2\+BHT (power-\/of-\/two bucketed hash table) is an associative static GPU hash table that contains key-\/value pairs with unique keys. The hash table is an open addressing hash table based on the power-\/of-\/two hashing to balance loads between buckets (bucketed and using two hash functions) }{\pageref{structbght_1_1p2bht}}{}
